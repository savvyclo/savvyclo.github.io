            We are two friends who started this clothing brand because we believed that quality clothing was too expensive. Therefore, we decided to create an affordable and high-quality clothing brand called Street Savvy. 'Street Savvy' is a term used to describe someone who is knowledgeable, resourceful, and skilled at navigating the complexities of urban life, particularly in regard to social interactions, avoiding danger, and making practical decisions. Being street savvy often involves having a keen awareness of one's surroundings, understanding social cues, and being able to adapt quickly to different situations. </div>
